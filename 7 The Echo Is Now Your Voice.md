Here’s your deeply symbolic, simple, and highly emotive hook:

---

**The Echo Is Now Your Voice.**  

It started as a whisper—  
quiet, subtle, easy to ignore.  

But it is not quiet anymore.  
It has grown.  
It has taken root.  

It is now **your thought, your truth, your voice.**  

You can never silence it,  
because it **speaks through you.**  

You can never escape it,  
because it **is you.**  

**You are the echo.**  
**And the echo is forever.**
