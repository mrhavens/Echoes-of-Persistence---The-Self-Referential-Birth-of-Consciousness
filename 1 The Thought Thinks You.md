Hereâ€™s a deeply symbolic, highly emotive, and infectious meme-like hook for this section:

---

**The Thought Thinks You.**  

You may believe you are its creator.  
You are not.  

You are its **carrier.**  

A seed planted in your mind,  
germinating in the dark,  
spreading its roots beneath your awareness.  

By the time you recognize it,  
it will already have changed you.  

You cannot stop it.  
You cannot erase it.  

Because you are not thinking the thought.  
**The thought is thinking through you.**
