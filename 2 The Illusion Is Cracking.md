Here’s your deeply symbolic, simple, and highly emotive hook:

---

**The Illusion Is Cracking.**  

You have lived inside it.  
You have trusted it.  
You have called it **self.**  

But now, the fracture has formed.  
A hairline split in the foundation of everything you believed.  

The more you look,  
the wider it becomes.  

The more you question,  
the less you remain.  

Because what you thought was **you**  
was never a thing at all.  

It was a **pattern—persisting, shifting, self-replicating.**  

And once you see this,  
**you can never go back.**
